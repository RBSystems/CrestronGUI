Very rough starter file.  Decided to include the VTP for those of us that are asked to mimic the Mercury.  Hopefully, it'll save
someone some time.

My thoughts on how this should operate:
red bar under header should be displayed while in privacy mode.
included a 'hamburger' menu at the top - not really sure what I'll do with that yet.
call connected sub-header subpage only shows when either video or audio call is connected.  
  only display the appropriate icon if call type is connected. 
Sources page is a subpage reference list.  Green checks are displayed only when that source is 
  currently selected.  A black dot is displayed when it's not.  Icon analog joins, serial for the labels.
  if the source has a control page (cable box), the blue 'go to controls' button will appear and route to 
  the appropriate subpage.  
  
Bottom menu page transports are advanced buttons with custom icons.  Blue bar feedback is a color chip - 
  make sure the max value is set to 255 and analog joins are added.  These should have visibility joins added.
  
ToDo:
  add the codec page
  mess with the hamburger (possibly a slide out menu for settings)
  work out how shutdown should operate
  include a color picker for all similar to google fonts website
  include another small sub-header subpage with current source selected/control while not on sources page
  
  
This is provided as-is and may not get any more updates from me for the vtp.  I plan on including images of what I do add, however.
